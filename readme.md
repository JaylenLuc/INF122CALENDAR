python 3.11.3

PREFACE: 
All relevant auxillary implementation design files are under the DESIGN_IMPLEMENTATION_DOC/ folder.
This repository only contains an EXE and does not contain a MacOS executable. You must compile it to .app using the file app.py.
This is because pyinstaller does not allow cross OS compilation.


Instructions: To run the EXE double click the app.exe file under the file path dist/app.exe
