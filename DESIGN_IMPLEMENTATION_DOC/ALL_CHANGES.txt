CHANGES:

No calendar class was needed because the calendar is actually a GUI component
in the GUI class, in this case it is the QMainWindow. A very similar fate holds True
for EventManager class. The event manager class are now methods and components within 
the GUI QMainWindow. They are now a series of signals from components (emitted events) and 
slots (event listeners). All these aforementioned changes are unvaoidable because 
they are components that are simple features that should come packaged with a GUI
framework. Besides that, User class and event class are essentially the same and missing functions
are because I chose to not implement calendar types or fully implement user switching and send and receive.
Only the potential feature of supporting multiple users is accounted for in the code and is fairly
easy to extend the code for.
